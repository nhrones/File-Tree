# File-Tree RPC

This application demonstrates RPC calls to an BuenoRPC broker service.    

The app initially makes a call to get all items from the root folder.    
The data returned is then loaded in a treeview UI.    
Selecting an item in the treeview will request its content from the broker.    
Any text content will then be presented in a code presentation control.
